# Degree Planner in 3 Phases
MRU degree planner application. Given a student with a any number of courses taken, the application creates a degree for the student that fullfills all prerequisites required for graduation. As a study of programming paradigms, this application will be built in 3 different languages: Python (procedural), Prolog (logical), and Haskell (functional). 

## Phase 1: Python
### Dependencies
Python v3.9 or higher  
#### For the scraper  
`pip install selenium`  
You also need to ensure you have a web driver for selenium. See https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers for more details (I use geckodriver for FireFox personally).

## Phase 2: Prolog
Development is done using [SWI-Prolog]{https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html}.

## Phase 3: Haskell
[GHCup]{https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/} is the reccomended installer for Haskell.
